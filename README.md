# Recursive Resources

This is an indirect port of 
[Resource Pack Organiser](https://github.com/chylex/Resource-Pack-Organizer) 
to modern versions of Minecraft.

Recursive Resources is a fabric mod that revamps the vanilla resource pack screen
to be more user-friendly with quality-of-life features like:

- Organize resource pack into folders that you can navigate from within the game
- Choose between folder view (navigate in and out of folders) and flat view (packs from all folders shown in a single list)
- Search pack names and description (supports the * wildcard)
- Sort packs and folders alphabetically A-Z or Z-A
