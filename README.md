## Project setup guide

In order to setup a workspace to play around with the source code, first clone this repository using your Git client (make sure to select the correct branch, they are named by Minecraft versions; master is always the latest work in progress version).

Once you cloned the repository, follow the [Getting Started with Forge](https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted) tutorial. You can skip the first 3 steps, the repository already comes with the Gradle build system.
